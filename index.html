      <p><abbr title="Make Interesting Stuff Club">MISC</abbr> is a place to make cool things on the interwebs without the usual constraints that come with making web for a living (e.g. business plans). People come with ideas of fun things to make, we form groups around those ideas, and we make things. We meet at the Aten Design Group office (3507 Ringsby Ct. #111, Denver, CO) at around 5:30pm on Tuesdays, except the 4th Tuesday of the month, when we don't meet. We also do impromptu meetings at other times, so if you'd like to meet, get in touch. Anyone ready to make fun things with others is welcome.</p>
      <h2>Some Guidelines:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Only personal projects</strong> &mdash; leave your day job at the door, this is a chance to play with something new.</li>
        <li><strong>Fun &gt; money</strong> &mdash; we are sharpening our skills, and playing with new things. This is not a startup.</li>
        <li><strong>Teamwork!</strong> &mdash; if you can't convince anyone else to work on your idea, work on someone else's idea. It'll be more fun than working alone.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>Below are some projects we're talking about and/or working on.</p>
