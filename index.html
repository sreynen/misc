title: Make Interesting Stuff Club

<div id="home">
  <p>Make Interesting Stuff Club (MISC) is a place to make cool things on the interwebs. People come with ideas of fun things to make, we form groups around those ideas, and we make things. We meet at the Aten Design Group office (3507 Ringsby Ct. #111, Denver, CO) at around 5:30pm on Tuesdays, except the 4th Tuesday of the month, when we don&#8217;t meet. Anyone ready to make fun things with others is welcome.</p>
  <p>Some guidelines:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Only personal projects</strong> &#8212; leave your day job at the door, this is a chance to play with something new.</li>
    <li><strong>Fun > money</strong> &#8212; we are sharpening our skills, and playing with new things. This is M.I.S.C., business plans are written during B.M.W.E.P.C. (Bore Me With Endless Powerpoints Club)</li>
    <li><strong>Teamwork!</strong> &#8212; if you can&#8217;t convince anyone else to work on your idea, work on someone else&#8217;s idea. It&#8217;ll be more fun than working alone.</li>
  </ul>
