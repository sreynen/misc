* Only load words near current canvas position
* Make arrows scroll on hold
* Improve user display, make it easier to say ?I?m this user?, still without login
* "This is good" system to lock works
* Or flagging system to remove griefers?
* Track canvas state by time
* Add timestamp to URLs
* Interface for watching changes over time
