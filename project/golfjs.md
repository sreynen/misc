Golf JS

-----description

Scott made this site a long time ago, but never really launched it.

This site is a series of JavaScript challenges. The goal is to accomplish each challenge with as little JS code as possible, measured in character (keystroke) count of your code. In the current prototype, code is checked client-side and then fake submissions are deleted after submission. There might be a better way to do that.

-----status

Prototype exists at http://golfjs.com/
