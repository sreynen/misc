-----description

User sees a PHP error and some code, has to find the error and fix it as quickly as possible. Faster times is higher score.
Next steps:
Find a way to test PHP code without making it totally open execution. Maybe just highlight the problem code?
Make an interface to collect errors, with categories and difficulty
Build game interface
