Programming Games

-----description

Competitor writes functions that take a board and return a move. The game calls those functions to move game forward. Different functions compete for winner.
For example, a tic-tac-toe game would give each function a 3x3 array, and the function would return coordinates for the next play.
But tic-tac-toe is too determinate to be very interesting.
Something like Battleship could work well, where the best functions would adapt to play, not just analyze probabilities.
