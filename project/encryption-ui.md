proposed by Joe

-----description


Add widget to the field UI that allows encryption on text fields
Uses mcrypt
Has hook that allows devs to replace the standard encryption method
https://drupal.org/project/field_encrypt ?
[Joe] I saw this. It’s used by 80 sites, in beta, shows signs of unreliability.
[Scott] I’m interested in doing something with client-side encryption, so even server admin can’t access the data. Not sure if that would be Drupal-specific or not.
Next steps:
Learn more about encryption? Yep.
