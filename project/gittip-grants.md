Gittip Grants

-----description

Use [gittip.com](http://gittip.com/) API to do pledge drives for specific users who have goals set. For example, if someone has a goal of $100/week, I can offer to add a "matching grant" of $10/week if they reach that goal within 30 days. Then the site shows progress toward the goal and a countdown, sort of like Kickstarter. And maybe some tools for the recipient and/or granter to post updates.
