Re-use Solar System Project when possible.
Pull tickets from JIRA.
Pull new tickets as they are made.
Node.js?
Represent each ticket as animated 3D object.
Thoughts:
People are represented as planets.
Projects are represented as planets.
To dos are represented as moons.
Moons orbit like electrons around a nucleus, newer items are further out from the center.
Select a planet, relevant todos go into orbit around the planet, some essential data is shown, other planets and moons fall away, return button appears.
Or:
Somehow todos are represented as lava lamp bubbles.

###Next steps
