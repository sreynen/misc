Structured Content Editor for GitHub

-----description

The MISC website loads content almost entirely from a Github repository, which is fast and the code is simple. And the editing experience is okay for anyone who has a GitHub account, but it lacks structure and the GitHub interface isn't really designed for content entry.

[prose.io](http://prose.io/) makes the content entry process a little better, but doesn't add any structure. This project would make the interface even easier, e.g. by separating GitHub accounts from editor account, and also add structure.

On possible way to add structure is [Sir Trevor](http://madebymany.github.io/sir-trevor-js/). If that could save to stati JSON files with a JSONP callback, those files could be called remotely and maintain structure.
