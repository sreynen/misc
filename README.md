## Overview

This is the source for http://misc.ellaneous.org/, the website for the Make Interesting Stuff Club (MISC). Individual projects have their own repos. This is just an overview of the various projects. To contribute, fork the project and make a pull request. Each project should be documented in a separate markdown file in the project directory, split up by field. New projects should be added to the list of projects in project/index.txt. Upcoming meetings should be added to upcoming.md.
